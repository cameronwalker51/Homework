###When I look at this photo it reminds me of connections, Connections that 
could lead you to different scales and different avenues of life and ideas.
It also rreminds me of a certain intillect to hold the connectivity and to pass on
a certian positive charge to keep the connection strong and stable. It also inspires me 
to shine like light and never doubt where im going but to trust I will get there by the path that 
was given.
